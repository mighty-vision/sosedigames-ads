### ‚ö†Ô∏è Commom recommendations

1. Advertising platforms define size limits in zipped state. So 150kb limit is for already zipped ad;
2. Please, use image compressors. Like [Tinypng](http://tinypng.com) and [Svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
3. Add fallback for IE9, Opera 14 and other old browsers. Moderators test your ad at this browsers and you need correct working in it, not perfect, just something not horrible.
4. Control ad performance in task manager (Chrome: Shift + Esc). Moderators check the performance at simple office machines.
5. You can use some external lib's. They are defined at ad platforms webpage.
